[2017/02/21] Notice
* I started creating Wiki page. Anyone in the team can edit the contents of Wiki, so I am looking forward to your participation. You're welcome to share any Chinese resources related to our course.
* I realized that you CANNOT request to join github.com/PHBS. If you already created an account, email me (jaehyuk _AT_ phbs.pku.edu.cn)  your github ID so that I send you an invitation to join both PHBS organization and the [team](https://github.com/orgs/PHBS/teams/2016-tqf-ml).
* [This](http://blog.codeeval.com/codeevalblog/2015#.WKwjb1WGOUk=) is why you have to learn Python!
