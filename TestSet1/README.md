# Test Dataset for HW

We will do a series of exercises using [wine quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

The data is composed of quality of wine (scale from 1 to 10) and 11 other features of wine. Our goal is to model
a classifiers which can tell good (above-average) vs bad (below-average) wine. Use can use any method we learned in our class so far.

A few considerations are

HW will be evaluated at several states of progress. The first evaluation is by next Monday (3/20)
Try as much as you can do and upload the progress in python notebook format.

In the first week, try to focus

* Try to familiarize yourself with using Python (Numpy+Panda+sklearn) and python notebook
* Run linear regression AND classification (logistic OR SVM) using all features
* Check the error (RSS or classification error)
* Visuallize the results

In the following week, 

* Run Decision tree (with Boosting, RF, etc)
* Select/extract the most important 2~3 features rather than use all 11 festures.
